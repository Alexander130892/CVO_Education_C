C-compiler
    Mac OS: clang as standard (with xcode install) > gcc available, but little difference (so far)
    Linux (Ubuntu): installed by standard

RAND_MAX
    info Rand_max () 32767 vs 2147483647
        System Dependent: Its value varies based on the platform, compiler, and C library implementation.
        Minimum Value: The C standard guarantees that RAND_MAX is at least 32767 (\(2^{15}-1\)).
        Common Values:On many older systems or 16-bit environments, it is 32767.
        On many modern systems (like GNU C library/Linux), it is often \(2^{31}-1\) (2147483647).

    Compiling Exercise_00_flightData.c...
    /usr/bin/ld: /tmp/ccyZyzcO.o: in function fakeData':
    Exercise_00_flightData.c:(.text+0xd8): undefined reference to pow'

    Missing -lm Flag (Link Math Library)
    pow lives in the math library (libm). On macOS it's linked automatically, but on Linux (including Raspberry Pi) you have to explicitly tell the linker to include it.
        gcc Exercise_00_flightData.c -o Exercise_00_flightData -lm
    The -lm flag means "link math library".
