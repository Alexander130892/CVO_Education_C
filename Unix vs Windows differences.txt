RAND_MAX
    info Rand_max () 32767 vs 2147483647
        System Dependent: Its value varies based on the platform, compiler, and C library implementation.
        Minimum Value: The C standard guarantees that RAND_MAX is at least 32767 (\(2^{15}-1\)).
        Common Values:On many older systems or 16-bit environments, it is 32767.
        On many modern systems (like GNU C library/Linux), it is often \(2^{31}-1\) (2147483647).
